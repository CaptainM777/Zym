      Mutes a user so they can't talk in any text channels or use voice channels. If the

      If the user's DM's are closed, they will still be muted. It is suggested, however, that a 
      Mirror chat be opened up with them so that their mute can be explained. 


      If the user leaves the server before finishing their mute, they will be given the muted role
      when they come back. If their mute runs out before they rejoin the server, then they will not be
      given the muted role once they rejoin.


      The mute can be ended early by removing the muted role; an unmute will not get logged, however. It is strongly recommended that the 
      `-unmute` command be used to unmute users.
